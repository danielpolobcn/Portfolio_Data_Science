**Twitter API v2 Archive Search with geodata - Python**
This script will search the Twitter archive to retrieve tweets posted within the set timeframe and radius aorund a point defined by latitude and longitude. The output is delivered in CSV format and includes the timestamp, name and coordinates of the place where every tweet was posted from. An Academic Research account is needed to perfom full archive searches in Twittter's API, however an essential account will grant access to recent tweets (up to one week old) by pointing the query to the "recent" endpoint instead of the "all" one.
