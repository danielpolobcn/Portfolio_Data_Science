**Password strength classifier - Python.** Deploying a neural network to classify the strength of 670k passwords provided as raw strings into three tiers: low, medium, high. The model is built with Keras (TensorFlow).

**Twitter API v2 Archive Search with geodata - Python.** This script will search the Twitter archive to retrieve tweets posted within the set timeframe and radius around a point defined by latitude and longitude. The output is delivered in CSV format and includes the timestamp and the name and coordinates of the place where every tweet was posted from. An Academic Research account is needed to perfom full archive searches in Twitter API, however an essential account will grant access to recent tweets (up to one week old) by pointing the query to the "recent" endpoint instead of the "all" one.
